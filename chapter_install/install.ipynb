    "Step 2 is to download the compressed file containing the code of this book. It is available at https://www.d2l.ai/d2l-en-1.0.zip. After downloading the zip file, create a folder `d2l-en` and extract the zip file into the folder. At the current folder, enter `cmd` on the address bar of File Explorer to enter the command line mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3 is to create a virtual (running) environment using conda to install the libraries needed by this book. Here `environment.yml` is placed in the downloaded zip file. Open the file with a text editor to see the libraries (such as MXNet and `d2lzh` package) and their version numbers on which running the code of the book is dependent."
