    "# Multilayer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters we showed how you could implement multiclass logistic regression (also called softmax regression) for classifying images of clothing into the 10 possible categories. This is where things start to get fun. We understand how to wrangle data, coerce our outputs into a valid probability distribution (via `softmax`), how to apply an appropriate loss function, and how to optimize over our parameters. Now that we’ve covered these preliminaries, we can extend our toolbox to include deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that before, we mapped our inputs directly onto our outputs through a single linear transformation via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\mathbf{o}} = \\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b})\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/singlelayer.png\" alt=\"Single layer perceptron with 5 output units.\" width=275 height=88/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If our labels really were related to our input data by an approximately linear function, then this approach might be adequate. But linearity is a *strong assumption*. Linearity means that given an output of interest, for each input, increasing the value of the input should either drive the value of the output up or drive it down, irrespective of the value of the other inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From one to many\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the case of classifying cats and dogs based on black and white images. That’s like saying that for each pixel, increasing its value either increases the probability that it depicts a dog or decreases it. That’s not reasonable. After all, the world contains both black dogs and black cats, and both white dogs and white cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teasing out what is depicted in an image generally requires allowing more complex relationships between our inputs and outputs, considering the possibility that our pattern might be characterized by interactions among the many features. In these cases, linear models will have low accuracy. We can model a more general class of functions by incorporating one or more hidden layers. The easiest way to do this is to stack a bunch of layers of neurons on top of each other. Each layer feeds into the layer above it, until we generate an output. This architecture is commonly called a “multilayer perceptron”. With an MLP, we stack a bunch of layers on top of each other. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/mlp.png\" alt=\"Multilayer perceptron with hidden layers. This example contains a hidden layer with 5 hidden units in it. \" width=276 height=150/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the multilayer perceptron above, the number of inputs and outputs is 4 and 3 respectively, and the hidden layer in the middle contains 5 hidden units. Since the input layer does not involve any calculations, there are a total of 2 layers in the multilayer perceptron. The neurons in the hidden layer are fully connected to the inputs within the input layer. The neurons in the output layer and the neurons in the hidden layer are also fully connected. Therefore, both the hidden layer and the output layer in the multilayer perceptron are fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From linear to nonlinear\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us write out what is happening mathematically in the picture above, e.g. for multiclass classification.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{h} & = \\mathbf{W}_1 \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}_1 \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathbf{o} & = \\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{h} + \\mathbf{b}_2 \\\\\n",
    "    \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} & = \\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{o})\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the approach above is that we have gained nothing over a simple single layer perceptron since we can collapse out the hidden layer by an equivalently parametrized single layer perceptron using $\\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{W}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{o} = \\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{h} + \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\mathbf{W}_2 (\\mathbf{W}_1 \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}_1) + \\mathbf{b}_2 = (\\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{W}_1) \\mathbf{x} + (\\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2) = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this we need another key ingredient - a nonlinearity $\\sigma$ such as $\\mathrm{max}(x,0)$ after each layer. Once we do this, it becomes impossible to merge layers. This yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{h} & = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_1 \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}_1) \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathbf{o} & = \\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{h} + \\mathbf{b}_2 \\\\\n",
    "    \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} & = \\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{o})\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly we could continue stacking such hidden layers, e.g. $\\mathbf{h}_1 = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_1 \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}_1)$ and $\\mathbf{h}_2 = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{h}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2)$ on top of each other to obtain a true multilayer perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilayer perceptrons can account for complex interactions in the inputs because the hidden neurons depend on the values of each of the inputs. It’s easy to design a hidden node that that does arbitrary computation, such as, for instance, logical operations on its inputs. And it’s even widely known that multilayer perceptrons are universal approximators. That means that even for a single-hidden-layer neural network, with enough nodes, and the right set of weights, it could model any function at all! Actually learning that function is the hard part. And it turns out that we can approximate functions much more compactly if we use deeper (vs wider) neural networks. We’ll get more into the math in a subsequent chapter, but for now let’s actually build an MLP. In this example, we’ll implement a multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers and one output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectorization and mini-batch\n",
    "\n",
    "When given a mini-batch of samples we can use vectorization to gain better efficiency in implementation. In a nutshell, we replace vectors by matrices. As before, denote by $\\mathbf{X}$ the matrix of inputs from a minibatch. Then an MLP with two hidden layers can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{H}_1 & = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_1 \\mathbf{X} + \\mathbf{b}_1) \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathbf{H}_2 & = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_2 \\mathbf{H}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2) \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathbf{O} & = \\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{W}_3 \\mathbf{H}_2 + \\mathbf{b}_3)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easy to implement and easy to optimize. With some abuse of notation we define the nonlinearity $\\sigma$ to apply to its inputs on a row-wise fashion, i.e. one observation at a time, often one coordinate at a time. This is true for most activation functions (the [batch normalization](../chapter_convolutional-neural-networks/batch-norm.md) is a notable exception from that rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look a bit more at examples of activation functions. After all, it is this alternation between linear and nonlinear terms that makes deep networks work. A rather popular choice, due to its simplicity of implementation and its efficacy is the ReLu function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReLU Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReLU (rectified linear unit) function provides a very simple nonlinear transformation. Given the element $x$, the function is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \\max(x, 0).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be understood that the ReLU function retains only positive elements and discards negative elements. To get a better idea of what it looks like it helps to plot it. For convenience we define a plotting function `xyplot` to take care of the gruntwork."
