While a powerful deep learning framework minimizes repetitive work, relying on it too much to make things easy can make it hard to properly understand how deep learning works. This matters in particular if we want to change things later, e.g. define our own layers, loss functions, etc. Because of this, we start by describing how to implement linear regression training using only NDArray and `autograd`.\n",

Its purpose is to return the features and tags of random `batch_size` (batch size) examples every time it's called. One might wonder why we are not reading one observation at a time but rather construct an iterator which returns a few observations at a time. This has mostly to do with efficiency when optimizing. Recall that when we processed one dimension at a time the algorithm was quite slow. The same thing happens when processing single observations vs. an entire 'batch' of them, which can be represented as a matrix rather than just a vector. In particular, GPUs are much faster when it comes to dealing with matrices, up to an order of magnitude. This is one of the reasons why deep learning usually operates on mini-batches rather than singletons."
