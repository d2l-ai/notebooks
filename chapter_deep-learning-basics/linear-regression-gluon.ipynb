This can become complicated as we build complex models. Gluon provides a large number of predefined layers, which allow us to focus especially on the layers used to construct the model rather than having to focus on the implementation.\n",

We will first define a model variable `net`, which is a `Sequential` instance. In Gluon, a `Sequential` instance can be regarded as a container that concatenates the various layers in sequence. When constructing the model, we will add the layers in their order of occurrence in the container. When input data is given, each layer in the container will be calculated in order, and the output of one layer will be the input of the next layer."
