    "In machine learning, we *train* models to get better and better as a function of experience. Usually, *getting better* means minimizing a *loss function*, i.e. a score that answers \"how *bad* is our model?\" With neural networks, we typically choose loss functions that are differentiable with respect to our parameters. Put simply, this means that for each of the model's parameters, we can determine how much *increasing* or *decreasing* it might affect the loss. While the calculations are straightforward, for complex models, working it out by hand can be a pain (and often error-prone).\n",
    "\n",
    "The autograd package expedites this work by automatically calculating derivatives. And while most other libraries require that we compile a symbolic graph to take automatic derivatives, `autograd` allows you to take derivatives while writing  ordinary imperative code. Every time you make pass through your model, `autograd` builds a graph on the fly, through which it can immediately backpropagate gradients. If you are unfamiliar with some of the math, e.g. gradients, please refer to the [“Mathematical Basics”](../chapter_appendix/math.md) section in the appendix."
