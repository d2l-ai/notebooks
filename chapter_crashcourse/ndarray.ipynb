    "# Manipulating Data with `ndarray`\n",

    "Generally, there are two important things we need to do with:\n",
    "(i) acquire it and (ii) process it once it's inside the computer.\n",
    "There's no point in trying to acquire data if we don't even know how to store it, so let's get our hands dirty first by playing with synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by introducing NDArrays, MXNet's primary tool for storing and transforming data. If you've worked with NumPy before, you'll notice that NDArrays are, by design, similar to NumPy's multi-dimensional array. However, they confer a few key advantages. First, NDArrays support asynchronous computation on CPU, GPU, and distributed cloud architectures. Second, they provide support for automatic differentiation. These properties make NDArray an ideal ingredient for machine learning.\n",

    "In this chapter, we'll get you going with the basic functionality. Don't worry if you don't understand any of the basic math, like element-wise operations or normal distributions. In the next two chapters we'll take another pass at NDArray, teaching you both the math you'll need and how to realize it in code. For even more math, see the [\"Math\"](../chapter_appendix/math.md) section in the appendix.\n",
