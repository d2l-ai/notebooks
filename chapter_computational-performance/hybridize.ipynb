On the other hand, we need to save the variable values of `e` and `f` until all the statements in `fancy_func` have been executed.

This leaves more room to optimize computation, since the system is able to view the entire program during its compilation. For example, during compilation, the program can be rewritten as `print((1 + 2) + (3 + 4))` or even directly rewritten as `print(10)`. Apart from reducing the amount of function calls, this process also saves memory.\n",

When designing Gluon, developers considered whether it was possible to harness the benefits of both imperative and symbolic programming. The developers believed that users should be able to develop and debug using pure imperative programming, while having the ability to convert most programs into symbolic programming to be run when product-level computing performance and deployment are required This was achieved by Gluon through the introduction of hybrid programming.\n",

    "In hybrid programming, we can build models using either the HybridBlock or the HybridSequential classes. By default, they are executed in the same way Block or Sequential classes are executed in imperative programming. When the `hybridize` function is called, Gluon will convert the program’s execution into the style used in symbolic programming. In fact, most models can make use of hybrid programming’s execution style.\n",

This is because a symbolic program has been produced since the last time `net(x)` was run by calling the `hybridize` function. Afterwards, when we run `net(x)` again, MXNet will no longer need to access Python code, but can directly perform symbolic programming at the C++ backend. This is another reason why model computing performance will be improve after the `hybridize` function is called. However, there is always the potential that any programs we write will suffer a loss in flexibility. If we want to use the three lines of print statements to debug the code in the above example, they will be skipped over and we would not be able to print when the symbolic program is executed. Additionally, in the case of a few functions not supported by Symbol (like `asnumpy`), and operations in-place like `a += b` and `a[:] = a + b` (must be rewritten as `a = a + b`).
