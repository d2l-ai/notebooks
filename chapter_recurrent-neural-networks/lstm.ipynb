    "# Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "@TODO(smolix/astonzhang): the data set was just changed from lyrics to time machine, so descriptions/hyperparameters have to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes another commonly used gated recurrent neural network: long short-term memory (LSTM) [1]. Its structure is slightly more complicated than that of a gated recurrent unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Long Short-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Three gates are introduced in LSTM: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate, as well as memory cells in the same shape as the hidden state (some literature treats memory cells as a special kind of hidden state) used to record additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Gates, Forget Gates, and Output Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the reset gate and the update gate in the gated recurrent unit, as shown in Figure 6.7, the input of LSTM gates is the current time step input $\\boldsymbol{X}_t$ and the hidden state of the previous time step $\\boldsymbol{H}_{t-1}$. The output is computed by the fully connected layer with a sigmoid function as its activation function. As a result, the three gate elements all have a value range of $[0,1]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we assume there are $h$ hidden units and, for a given time step $t$, the mini-batch input is $\\boldsymbol{X}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ (number of examples: $n$, number of inputs: $d$）and the hidden state of the last time step is $\\boldsymbol{H}_{t-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$.\n",
    "For time step $t$, the input gate $\\boldsymbol{I}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$, forget gate $\\boldsymbol{F}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$, and output gate $\\boldsymbol{O}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{I}_t &= \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{X}_t \\boldsymbol{W}_{xi} + \\boldsymbol{H}_{t-1} \\boldsymbol{W}_{hi} + \\boldsymbol{b}_i),\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Candidate Memory Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, LSTM needs to compute the candidate memory cell $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{C}}_t$. Its computation is similar to the three gates described above, but using a tanh function with a value range for $[-1, 1] as activation function, as shown in Figure 6.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/lstm_1.png\" alt=\"Computation of candidate memory cells in LSTM. \" width=414 height=204/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For time step $t$, the candidate memory cell $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{C}}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ is calculated by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{C}}_t = \\text{tanh}(\\boldsymbol{X}_t \\boldsymbol{W}_{xc} + \\boldsymbol{H}_{t-1} \\boldsymbol{W}_{hc} + \\boldsymbol{b}_c),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\boldsymbol{W}_{xc} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times h}$ and $\\boldsymbol{W}_{hc} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times h}$ are weight parameters and $\\boldsymbol{b}_c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times h}$ is a bias parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "We can control flow of information in the hidden state use input, forget, and output gates with an element value range between $[0, 1]$. This is also generally achieved by using multiplication by element (symbol $\\odot$). The computation of the current time step memory cell $\\boldsymbol{C}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ combines the information of the previous time step memory cells and the current time step candidate memory cells, and controls the flow of information through forget gate and input gate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{C}_t = \\boldsymbol{F}_t \\odot \\boldsymbol{C}_{t-1} + \\boldsymbol{I}_t \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{C}}_t.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure 6.9, the forget gate controls whether the information in the memory cell $\\boldsymbol{C}_{t-1}$ of the last time step is passed to the current time step, and the input gate can control how the input of the current time step $\\boldsymbol{X}_t$ flows into the memory cells of the current time step through the candidate memory cell $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{C}}_t$. If the forget gate is always approximately 1 and the input gate is always approximately 0, the past memory cells will be saved over time and passed to the current time step. This design can cope with the vanishing gradient problem in recurrent neural networks and better capture dependencies for time series with large time step distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/lstm_2.png\" alt=\"Computation of memory cells in LSTM. Here, the multiplication sign indicates multiplication by element. \" width=414 height=209/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hidden States\n",
    "\n",
    "With memory cells, we can also control the flow of information from memory cells to the hidden state $\\boldsymbol{H}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ through the output gate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{H}_t = \\boldsymbol{O}_t \\odot \\text{tanh}(\\boldsymbol{C}_t).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The tanh function here ensures that the hidden state element value is between -1 and 1. It should be noted that when the output gate is approximately 1, the memory cell information will be passed to the hidden state for use by the output layer; and when the output gate is approximately 0, the memory cell information is only retained by itself. Figure 6.10 shows the computation of the hidden state in LSTM.\n",
