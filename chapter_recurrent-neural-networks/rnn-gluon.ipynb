In the case of a language model the number of inputs would be the one-hot vector length (the dictionary size). In addition, as an `rnn.RNN` instance in Gluon, `rnn_layer` returns the output and hidden state after forward computation. The output refers to the sequence of hidden states that the RNN computes over various time steps. They are used as input for subsequent output layers. Note that the output does not involve any conversion to characters or any other post-processing. This is so, since the RNN itself has no concept of what to do with the vectors that it generates. In short, its shape is given by (time step, batch size, number of hidden units). \n",

This can be used to initialize the next time step: when there are multiple layers in the hidden layer, the hidden state of each layer is recorded in this variable. For recurrent neural networks such as [Long Short Term Memory](lstm.md) (LSTM) networks, the variables also contains other state information. We will introduce LSTM and deep RNNs later in this chapter."
