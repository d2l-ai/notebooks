    "# Padding and Stride\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, our input had a height and width of 3 \n",
    "and a convolution kernel with a height and width of 2, \n",
    "yielding an output with a height and a width of 2. \n",
    "In general, assuming the input shape is $n_h\\times n_w$ \n",
    "and the convolution kernel window shape is $k_h\\times k_w$, \n",
    "then the output shape will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(n_h-k_h+1) \\times (n_w-k_w+1).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the output shape of the convolutional layer \n",
    "is determined by the shape of the input \n",
    "and the shape of the convolution kernel window. \n",
    "\n",
    "In several cases we might want to incorporate particular techniques—padding and strides—regarding the size of the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In general, since kernels generally have width and height greater than 1,\n",
    "that means that after applying many successive convolutions,\n",
    "we will wind up with an output that is much smaller than our input. \n",
    "If we start with a 240x240 pixel image, 10 layers of 5x5 convolutions \n",
    "reduce the image to 200x200 pixels, slicing off 30% of the image and with it obliterating any interesting information on the boundaries of the original image. *Padding* handles this issue.\n",
    "* In some cases, we want to reduce the resolution drastically if say we find our original input resolution to be unweildy. *Strides* can help in these instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, one tricky issue when applying convolutional layers\n",
    "is that losing pixels on the permimeter of our image. \n",
    "Since we typically use small kernels, \n",
    "for any given convolution, \n",
    "we might only lose a few pixels, \n",
    "but this can add up as we apply \n",
    "many successive convolutional layers. \n",
    "One straightforward solution to this problem \n",
    "is to add extra pixels of filler around the boundary of our input image, \n",
    "thus increasing the effective size of the image \n",
    "Typically, we set the values of the extra pixels to 0. \n",
    "In the figure below, we pad a $3 \\times 5$ input,\n",
    "increasing its size to $5 \\times 7$. \n",
    "The corresponding output then increases to a $4 \\times 6$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/conv_pad.png\" alt=\"Two-dimensional cross-correlation with padding. The shaded portions are the input and kernel array elements used by the first output element: $0\\times0+0\\times1+0\\times2+0\\times3=0$. \" width=284 height=120/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if we add a total of $p_h$ rows of padding\n",
    "(roughly half on top and half on bottom)\n",
    "and a total of $p_w$ columns of padding \n",
    "(roughly half on the left and half on the right), \n",
    "the output shape will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(n_h-k_h+p_h+1)\\times(n_w-k_w+p_w+1),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the height and width of the output\n",
    " will increase by $p_h$ and $p_w$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we will want to set $p_h=k_h-1$ and $p_w=k_w-1$ \n",
    "to give the input and output the same height and width. \n",
    "This will make it easier to predict the output shape of each layer \n",
    "when constructing the network. \n",
    "Assuming that $k_h$ is odd here, \n",
    "we will pad $p_h/2$ rows on both sides of the height. \n",
    "If $k_h$ is even, one possibility is to \n",
    "pad $\\lceil p_h/2\\rceil$ rows on the top of the input \n",
    "and $\\lfloor p_h/2\\rfloor$ rows on the bottom. \n",
    "We will pad both sides of the width in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks commonly use convolutional kernels \n",
    "with odd height and width values, such as 1, 3, 5, or 7.\n",
    "Choosing odd kernel sizes has the benefit \n",
    "that we can preserve the spatial dimensionality \n",
    "while padding with the same number of rows on top and bottom,\n",
    "and the same number of columns on left and right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, this practice of using odd kernels \n",
    "and padding to precisely preserve dimensionality \n",
    "offers a clerical benefit.\n",
    "For any two-dimensional array `X`, \n",
    "when the kernels size is odd \n",
    "and the number of padding rows and columns \n",
    "on all sides are the same,\n",
    "producing an output with the have the same height and width as the input, \n",
    "we know that the output `Y[i,j]` is calculated \n",
    "by cross-correlation of the input and convolution kernel \n",
    "with the window centered on `X[i,j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we create a two-dimensional convolutional layer \n",
    "with a height and width of 3 \n",
    "and apply 1 pixel of padding on all sides.\n",
    "Given an input with a height and width of 8,\n",
    " we find that the height and width of the output is also 8."
