    "# Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "As we process images (or other data sources) we will eventually want to reduce the resolution of the images. After all, we typically want to output an estimate that does not depend on the dimensionality of the original image. Secondly, when detecting lower-level features, such as edge detection (we covered this in the section on [convolutional layers](conv-layer.md)), we often want to have some degree of invariance to translation. For instance, if we take the image `X` with a sharp delineation between black and white and if we shift it by one pixel to the right, i.e. `Z[i,j] = X[i,j+1]`, then the output for for the new image `Z` will be vastly different. The edge will have shifted by one pixel and with it all the activations. In reality objects hardly ever occur exactly at the same place. In fact, even with a tripod and a stationary object, vibration of the camera due to the movement of the shutter might shift things by a pixel or so (this is why high end cameras have a special option to fix this). Given that, we need a mathematical device to address the problem.\n",

    "This section introduces pooling layers, which were proposed to alleviate the excessive sensitivity of the convolutional layer to location and to reduce the resolution of images through the processing pipeline.\n",

    "## Maximum Pooling and Average Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Like convolutions, pooling computes the output for each element in a fixed-shape window (also known as a pooling window) of input data. Different from the cross-correlation computation of the inputs and kernels in the convolutional layer, the pooling layer directly calculates the maximum or average value of the elements in the pooling window. These operations are called maximum pooling or average pooling respectively. In maximum pooling, the pooling window starts from the top left of the input array, and slides in the input array from left to right and top to bottom. When the pooling window slides to a certain position, the maximum value of the input subarray in the window is the element at the corresponding location in the output array.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/pooling.png\" alt=\"Maximum pooling with a pooling window shape of $2\\times 2$. The shaded portions represent the first output element and the input element used for its computation: $\\max(0,1,3,4)=4$\" width=179 height=81/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output array in the figure above has a height of 2 and a width of 2. The four elements are derived from the maximum value of $\\text{max}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\\max(4,5,7,8)=8.\\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Average pooling works like maximum pooling, only with the maximum operator replaced by the average operator. The pooling layer with a pooling window shape of $p \\times q$ is called the $p \\times q$ pooling layer. The pooling operation is called $p \\times q$ pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us return to the object edge detection example mentioned at the beginning of this section. Now we will use the output of the convolutional layer as the input for $2\\times 2$ maximum pooling. Set the convolutional layer input as `X` and the pooling layer output as `Y`. Whether or not the values of `X[i, j]` and `X[i, j+1]` are different, or `X[i, j+1]` and `X[i, j+2]` are different, the pooling layer outputs all include `Y[i, j]=1`. That is to say, using the $2\\times 2$ maximum pooling layer, we can still detect if the pattern recognized by the convolutional layer moves no more than one element in height and width.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, we implement the forward computation of the pooling layer in the `pool2d` function. This function is very similar to the `corr2d` function in the section on [convolutions](conv-layer.md). The only difference lies in the computation of the output `Y`."
