    "# Multiple Input and Output Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have described the multiple channels\n",
    "that comprise each image (e.g. color images have the standard RGB channels \n",
    "to indicate the amount of red, green and blue),\n",
    "until now, we simplified all of our numerical examples \n",
    "by working with just a single input and a single output channel.\n",
    "This has allowed us to think of our inputs, convolutional kernels,\n",
    "and outputs each as two-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we add channels into the mix, \n",
    "our inputs and hidden representations  \n",
    "both become three-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "For example, each RGB input image has shape $3\\times h\\times w$. \n",
    "We refer to this axis, with a size of 3, as the channel dimension. \n",
    "In this section, we will take a deeper look \n",

    "## Multiple Input Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "When the input data contains multiple channels, \n",
    "we need to construct a convolution kernel \n",
    "with the same number of input channels as the input data, \n",
    "so that it can perform cross-correlation with the input data. \n",
    "Assuming that the number of channels for the input data is $c_i$, \n",
    "the number of input channels of the convolution kernel also needs to be $c_i$. If our convolution kernel's window shape is $k_h\\times k_w$,\n",
    "then when $c_i=1$, we can think of our convolution kernel \n",
    "as just a two-dimensional array of shape $k_h\\times k_w$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when $c_i>1$, we need a kernel \n",
    "that contains an array of shape $k_h\\times k_w$ *for each input channel*. Concatenating these $c_i$ arrays together \n",
    "yields a convolution kernel of shape $c_i\\times k_h\\times k_w$. \n",
    "Since the input and convolution kernel each have $c_i$ channels, \n",
    "we can perform a cross-correlation operation \n",
    "on the two-dimensional array of the input \n",
    "and the two-dimensional kernel array of the convolution kernel \n",
    "for each channel, adding the $c_i$ results together \n",
    "(summing over the channels)\n",
    "to yield a two-dimensional array. \n",
    "This is the result of a two-dimensional cross-correlation \n",
    "between multi-channel input data and \n",
    "a *multi-input channel* convolution kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, we demonstrate an example \n",
    "of a two-dimensional cross-correlation with two input channels. \n",
    "The shaded portions are the first output element \n",
    "as well as the input and kernel array elements used in its computation: \n",
