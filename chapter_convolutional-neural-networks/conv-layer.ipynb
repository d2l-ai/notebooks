    "# Convolutions for Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how to design convolutional networks in theory, let's see how this works in practice. For the next chapters we will stick to dealing with images, since they constitute one of the most common use cases for convolutional networks. That is, we will discuss the two-dimensional case (image height and width). We begin with the cross-correlation operator that we introduced in the previous section. Strictly speaking, convolutional networks are a slight misnomer (but for notation only), since the operations are typically expressed as cross correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Cross-Correlation Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "In a convolutional layer, an input array and a correlation kernel array output an array through a cross-correlation operation. Let's see how this works for two dimensions. As shown below, the input is a two-dimensional array with a height of 3 and width of 3. We mark the shape of the array as $3 \\times 3$ or (3, 3). The height and width of the kernel array are both 2. This array is also called a kernel or filter in convolution computations. The shape of the kernel window (also known as the convolution window) depends on the height and width of the kernel, which is $2 \\times 2$.\n",

The shaded portions are the first output element and the input and kernel array elements used in its computation: $0\\times0+1\\times1+3\\times2+4\\times3=19$. \" width=209 height=83/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the two-dimensional cross-correlation operation, the convolution window starts from the top-left of the input array, and slides in the input array from left to right and top to bottom. When the convolution window slides to a certain position, the input subarray in the window and kernel array are multiplied and summed by element to get the element at the corresponding location in the output array. The output array has a height of 2 and width of 2, and the four elements are derived from a two-dimensional cross-correlation operation:\n",

    "4\\times0+5\\times1+7\\times2+8\\times3=43.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the output size is *smaller* than the input. In particular, the output size is given by the input size $H \\times W$ minus the size of the convolutional kernel $h \\times w$ via $(H-h+1) \\times (W-w+1)$. This is the case since we need enough space to 'shift' the convolutional kernel across the image (later we will see how to keep the size unchanged by padding the image with zeros around its boundary such that there's enough space to shift the kernel). Next, we implement the above process in the `corr2d` function. It accepts the input array `X` with the kernel array `K` and outputs the array `Y`."

    "Designing an edge detector by finite differences `[1, -1]` is neat if we know what we are looking for. However, as we look at larger kernels, or possibly multiple layers, it is next to impossible to specify such filters manually. Let's see whether we can learn the kernel that generated `Y` from `X` by looking at the (input, output) pairs only. We first construct a convolutional layer and initialize its kernel into a random array. Next, in each iteration, we use the squared error to compare `Y` and the output of the convolutional layer, then calculate the gradient to update the weight. For the sake of simplicity, the convolutional layer here ignores the bias.\n",
