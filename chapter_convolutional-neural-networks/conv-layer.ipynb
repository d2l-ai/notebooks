    "# Convolutions for Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how convolutional layers work in theory, \n",
    "we are ready to see how this works in practice. \n",
    "Since we have motivated convolutional neural networks\n",
    "by their applicability to image data,\n",
    "we will stick with image data in our examples,\n",
    "and begin by revisiting the convolutional layer\n",
    "that we introduced in the previous section. \n",
    "We note that strictly speaking, *convolutional* layers are a slight misnomer,\n",
    "since the operations are typically expressed as cross correlations.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Cross-Correlation Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "In a convolutional layer, an input array \n",
    "and a correlation kernel array are combined\n",
    "to produce an output array through a cross-correlation operation. \n",
    "Let's see how this works for two dimensions. \n",
    "In our example, the input is a two-dimensional array \n",
    "with a height of 3 and width of 3. \n",
    "We mark the shape of the array as $3 \\times 3$ or (3, 3). \n",
    "The height and width of the kernel array are both 2. \n",
    "Common names for this array in the deep learning research community\n",
    "include *kernel* and *filter*.\n",
    "The shape of the kernel window (also known as the convolution window) \n",
    "is given precisely by the height and width of the kernel \n",
    "(here it is $2 \\times 2$).\n",

    "\n",
    "In the two-dimensional cross-correlation operation, \n",
    "we begin with the convolution window positioned \n",

    "Here, the output array has a height of 2 and width of 2\n",

    "\n",

    "(later we will see how to keep the size unchanged \n",
    "by padding the image with zeros around its boundary \n",
