When the input dimension is greater than 2, by default, the `Dense` instance will treat all dimensions other than the first dimension (example dimension) as feature dimensions that require affine transformation, and will automatically convert the input into a two-dimensional matrix with rows of behavioral examples and columns of features. After calculation, the shape of the output matrix is (number of examples, number of outputs). If we want the fully connected layer to only perform affine transformation on the last dimension of the input while keeping the shapes of the other dimensions unchanged, we need to set the `flatten` option of the `Dense` instance to `False`. In the following example, the fully connected layer only performs affine transformation on the last dimension of the input, therefore, only the last dimension of the output shape becomes the number of outputs of the fully connected layer, i.e. 2."

    "## Evaluation of Translation Results\n",
    "\n",
    "BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is often used to evaluate machine translation results[1]. For any subsequence in the model prediction sequence, BLEU evaluates whether this subsequence appears in the label sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the precision of the subsequence with $n$ words is $p_n$. It is the ratio of the number of subsequences with $n$ matched words for the prediction sequence and label sequence to the number of subsequences with $n$ words in the prediction sequence. For example, assume the label sequence is $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, and the prediction sequence is $A$, $B$, $B$, $C$, $D$. Then $p_1 = 4/5, \\ p_2 = 3/4, \\ p_3 = 1/3, and \\ p_4 = 0$. Assume $len_{\\text{label}}$ and $len_{\\text{pred}}$ are the numbers of words in the label sequence and the prediction sequence. Then, BLEU is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\exp\\left(\\min\\left(0, 1 - \\frac{len_{\\text{label}}}{len_{\\text{pred}}}\\right)\\right) \\prod_{n=1}^k p_n^{1/2^n},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $k$ is the maximum number of words in the subsequence we wish to match. It can be seen that the BLEU is 1 when the prediction sequence and the label sequence are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because matching longer subsequences is more difficult than matching shorter subsequences, BLEU gives greater weight to the precision of longer subsequence matches. For example, when $p_n$ is fixed at 0.5, as $n$ increases, $0.5^{1/2} \\approx 0.7, 0.5^{1/4} \\approx 0.84, 0.5^{1/8} \\approx 0.92, and 0.5^{1/16} \\approx 0.96$. In addition, the prediction of shorter sequences by the model tends to obtain higher $p_n$ values. Therefore, the coefficient before the multiplication term in the above equation is a penalty to the shorter output. For example, when $k=2$, we assume the label sequence is $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$ and the prediction sequence is $A$, $B$. Although $p_1 = p_2 = 1$, the penalty factor is $\\exp(1-6/2) \\approx 0.14$, so the BLEU is also close to 0.14.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the BLEU"
