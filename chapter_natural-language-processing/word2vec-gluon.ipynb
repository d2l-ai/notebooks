    "In text data, there are generally some words that appear at high frequencies, such \"the\", \"a\", and \"in\" in English. Generally speaking, in a context window, it is better to train the word embedding model when a word (such as \"chip\") and a lower-frequency word (such as \"microprocessor\") appear at the same time, rather than when a word appears with a higher-frequency word (such as \"the\"). Therefore, when training the word embedding model, we can perform subsampling[2] on the words. Specifically, each indexed word $w_i$ in the data set will drop out at a certain probability. The dropout probability is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{P}(w_i) = \\max\\left(1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{f(w_i)}}, 0\\right),$$\n",

In order to avoid the effect of padding on the loss function calculation, we construct the mask variable `masks`, each element of which corresponds to an element in the concatenation of context and noise words, `contexts_negatives`. When an element in the variable `contexts_negatives` is a padding, the element in the mask variable `masks` at the same position will be 0. Otherwise, it takes the value 1. In order to distinguish between positive and negative examples, we also need to distinguish the context words from the noise words in the `contexts_negatives` variable.

    "\n",
    "* We can use Gluon to train a skip-gram model through negative sampling.\n",
    "* Subsampling attempts to minimize the impact of high-frequency words on the training of a word embedding model.\n",
    "* We can pad examples of different lengths to create mini-batches with examples of all the same length and use mask variables to distinguish between padding and non-padding elements, so that only non-padding elements participate in the calculation of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set `sparse_grad=True` when creating an instance of `nn.Embedding`. Does it accelerate training? Look up MXNet documentation to learn the meaning of this argument.\n",
    "* We use the `batchify` function to specify the mini-batch reading method in the `DataLoader` instance and print the shape of each variable in the first batch read. How should these shapes be calculated?\n",
    "* Try to find synonyms for other words.\n",
    "* Tune the hyper-parameters and observe and analyze the experimental results.\n",
    "* When the data set is large, we usually sample the context words and the noise words for the central target word in the current mini-batch only when updating the model parameters. In other words, the same central target word may have different context words or noise words in different epochs. What are the benefits of this sort of training? Try to implement this training method.\n",
