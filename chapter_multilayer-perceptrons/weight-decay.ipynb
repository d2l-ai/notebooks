    "# Weight Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we encountered overfitting and the need for capacity control. While increasing the training data set may mitigate overfitting, obtaining additional training data is often costly, hence it is preferable to control the complexity of the functions we use. In particular, we saw that we could control the complexity of a polynomial by adjusting its degree. While this might be a fine strategy for problems on one-dimensional data, this quickly becomes difficult to manage and too coarse. For instance, for vectors of dimensionality $D$ the number of monomials of a given degree $d$ is ${D -1 + d} \\choose {D-1}$. Hence, instead of controlling for the number of functions we need a more fine-grained tool for adjusting function complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Squared Norm Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used techniques is weight decay. It relies on the notion that among all functions $f$ the function $f = 0$ is the simplest of all. Hence we can measure functions by their proximity to zero. There are many ways of doing this. In fact there exist entire branches of mathematics, e.g. in functional analysis and the theory of Banach spaces which are devoted to answering this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purpose something much simpler will suffice:\n",
    "A linear function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}$ can be considered simple if its weight vector is small. We can measure this via $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2$. One way of keeping the weight vector small is to add its value as a penalty to the problem of minimizing the loss. This way if the weight vector becomes too large, the learning algorithm will prioritize minimizing $\\mathbf{w}$ over minimizing the training error. That's exactly what we want. To illustrate things in code, consider the previous section on [“Linear Regression”](linear-regression.md). There the loss is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\mathbf{w}, b) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ are the observations, $y^{(i)}$ are labels, and $(\\mathbf{w}, b)$ are the weight and bias parameters respectively. To arrive at the new loss function which penalizes the size of the weight vector we need to add $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2$, but how much should we add? This is where the regularization constant (hyperparameter) $\\lambda$ comes in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\mathbf{w}, b) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda \\geq 0$ governs the amount of regularization. For $\\lambda = 0$ we recover the previous loss function, whereas for $\\lambda > 0$ we ensure that $\\mathbf{w}$ cannot grow too large. The astute reader might wonder why we are squaring the weight vector. This is done both for computational convenience since it leads to easy to compute derivatives, and for statistical performance, as it penalizes large weight vectors a lot more than small ones. The stochastic gradient descent updates look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "w & \\leftarrow \\left(1- \\frac{\\eta\\lambda}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\right) \\mathbf{w} - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}} \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right),\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we update $\\mathbf{w}$ in accordance to the amount to which our estimate differs from the observation. However, we also shrink the size of $\\mathbf{w}$ towards $0$, i.e. the weight 'decays'. This is much more convenient than having to pick the number of parameters as we did for polynomials. In particular, we now have a continuous mechanism for adjusting the complexity of $f$. Small values of $\\lambda$ correspond to fairly unconstrained $\\mathbf{w}$ whereas large values of $\\lambda$ constrain $\\mathbf{w}$ considerably. Since we don't want to have large bias terms either, we often add $b^2$ as penalty, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-dimensional Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-dimensional regression it is difficult to pick the 'right' dimensions to omit. Weight-decay regularization is a much more convenient alternative. We will illustrate this below. But first we need to generate some data via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = 0.05 + \\sum_{i = 1}^d 0.01 x_i + \\epsilon \\text{ where }\n",
    "\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.01)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we have additive Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 0.01. In order to observe overfitting more easily we pick a high-dimensional problem with $d = 200$ and a deliberatly low number of training examples, e.g. 20. As before we begin with our import ritual (and data generation)."
