    "# Weight Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have characterized the problem of overfitting \n",
    "and motivated the need for capacity control,\n",
    "we can begin discussing some of the popular techniques\n",
    "used to these ends in practice.\n",
    "Recall that we can always mitigate overfitting \n",
    "by going out and collecting more training data,\n",
    "that can be costly and time consuming,\n",
    "typically making it impossible in the short run.\n",
    "For now, let's assume that we have already obtained \n",
    "as much high-quality data as our resources permit\n",
    "and focus on techniques aimed at limiting the capacity \n",
    "of the fuction classes under consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our toy example, \n",
    "we saw that we could control the complexity of a polynomial \n",
    "by adjusting its degree. \n",
    "However, most of machine learning \n",
    "does not consist of polynomial curve fitting.\n",
    "And moreover, even when we focus on polynomial regression,\n",
    "when we deal with high-dimensional data,\n",
    "manipulating model capacity by tweaking the degree $d$ is problematic.\n",
    "To see why, note that for multivariate data\n",
    "we must generalize the concept of polynomials \n",
    "to include *monomials*, which are simply\n",
    "products of powers of variables.\n",
    "For example, $x_1^2 x_2$, and $x_3 x_5^2$ are both monomials of degree $3$.\n",
    "The number of such terms with a given degree $d$\n",
    "blows up as a function of the degree $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, for vectors of dimensionality $D$,\n",
    "the number of monomials of a given degree $d$ is ${D -1 + d} \\choose {D-1}$.\n",
    "Hence, a small change in degree, even from say $1$ to $2$ or $2$ to $3$ \n",
    "would entail a massive blowup in the complexity of our model.\n",
    "Thus, tweaking the degree is too blunt a hammer.\n",
    "Instead, we need a more fine-grained tool \n",
    "for adjusting function complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Squared Norm Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weight decay* (commonly called *L2* regularization), \n",
    "might be the most widely-used technique \n",
    "for regularizing parametric machine learning models.\n",
    "The basic intuition behind weight decay is \n",
    "the notion that among all functions $f$, \n",
    "the function $f = 0$ is the simplest. \n",
    "Intuitively, we can then measure functions by their proximity to zero. \n",
    "But how precisely should we measure\n",
    "the distance between a function and zero? \n",
    "There is no single right answer.\n",
    "In fact, entire branches of mathematics, \n",
    "e.g. in functional analysis and the theory of Banach spaces\n",
    "are devoted to answering this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our present purposes, a very simple interpretation will suffice:\n",
    "We will consider a linear function \n",
    "$f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}$ \n",
    "to be simple if its weight vector is small. \n",
    "We can measure this via $||mathbf{w}||^2$. \n",
    "One way of keeping the weight vector small \n",
    "is to add its norm as a penalty term \n",
    "to the problem of minimizing the loss. \n",
    "Thus we replace our original objective, \n",
    "*minimize the prediction error on the training labels*,\n",
    "with new objective,\n",
    "*minimize the sum of the prediction error and the penalty term*.\n",
    "Now, if the weight vector becomes too large, \n",
    "our learning algorithm will find more profit in\n",
    "minimizing the norm $|| \\mathbf{w} ||^2$ \n",
    "versus minimizing the training error. \n",
    "That's exactly what we want. \n",
    "To illustrate things in code, let's revive our previous example\n",
    "from our chapter on [Linear Regression](linear-regression.md). \n",
    "There, our loss was given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\mathbf{w}, b) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ are the observations, \n",
    "$y^{(i)}$ are labels, and $(\\mathbf{w}, b)$ \n",
    "are the weight and bias parameters respectively. \n",
    "To arrive at a new loss function \n",
    "that penalizes the size of the weight vector, \n",
    "we need to add $||mathbf{w}||^2$, but how much should we add? \n",
    "To address this, we need to add a new hyperparameter,\n",
    "that we will call the *regularization constant* and denote by $\\lambda$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\mathbf{w}, b) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This non-negatice parameter $\\lambda \\geq 0$ \n",
    "governs the amount of regularization. \n",
    "For $\\lambda = 0$, we recover our original loss function, \n",
    "whereas for $\\lambda > 0$ we ensure that $\\mathbf{w}$ cannot grow too large. The astute reader might wonder why we are squaring \n",
    "the norm of the weight vector. \n",
    "We do this for two reasons.\n",
    "First, we do it for computational convenience.\n",
    "By squaring the L2 norm, we remove the square root,\n",
    "leaving the sum of squares of each component of the weight vector.\n",
    "This is convenient because it is easy to compute derivatives of a sum of terms (the sum of derivatives equals the derivative of the sum). \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you might ask, why the L2 norm in the first place and not the L1 norm, or some other distance function.\n",
    "In fact, several other choices are valid \n",
    "and are popular throughout statistics.\n",
    "While L2-regularized linear models constitute \n",
    "the classic *ridge regression* algorithm\n",
    "L1-regularizaed linear regression \n",
    "is a similarly fundamental model in statistics \n",
    "popularly known as *lasso regression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "One mathematical reason for working with the L2 norm and not some other norm,\n",
    "is that it penalizes large components of the weight vector\n",
    "much more than it penalizes small ones. \n",
    "This encourages our learning algorithm to discover models \n",
    "which distribute their weight across a larger number of features,\n",
    "which might make them more robust in practice \n",
    "since they do not depend precariously on a single feature.\n",
    "The stochastic gradient descent updates for L2-regularied regression\n",
    "are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "w & \\leftarrow \\left(1- \\frac{\\eta\\lambda}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\right) \\mathbf{w} - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}} \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right),\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we update $\\mathbf{w}$ based on the amount \n",
    "by which our estimate differs from the observation. \n",
    "However, we also shrink the size of $\\mathbf{w}$ towards $0$.\n",
    "That's why the method is sometimes called \"weight decay\":\n",
    "because the penalty term literally causes our optimization algorthm \n",
    "to *decay* the magnitude of the weight at each step of training. \n",
    "This is more convenient than having to pick \n",
    "the number of parameters as we did for polynomials. \n",
    "In particular, we now have a continuous mechanism \n",
    "for adjusting the complexity of $f$. \n",
    "Small values of $\\lambda$ correspond to unconstrained $\\mathbf{w}$,\n",
    "whereas large values of $\\lambda$ constrain $\\mathbf{w}$ considerably. \n",
    "Since we don't want to have large bias terms either, \n",
    "we often add $b^2$ as a penalty, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-dimensional Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-dimensional regression it is difficult \n",
    "to pick the 'right' dimensions to omit. \n",
    "Weight-decay regularization is a much more convenient alternative. \n",
    "We will illustrate this below.\n",
    "First, we will generate some synthetic data as before\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = 0.05 + \\sum_{i = 1}^d 0.01 x_i + \\epsilon \\text{ where }\n",
    "\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.01)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "representing our label as a linear function of our inputs,\n",
    "corrupted by Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 0.01. \n",
    "To observe the effects of overfitting more easily,\n",
    "we can make our problem high-dimensional,\n",
    "setting the data dimension to $d = 200$ \n",
    "and working with a relatively small number of training examples—here we'll set the sample size to 20:"

    "1. Experiment with the value of $\\lambda$ in the estimation problem in this page. Plot training and test accuracy as a function of $\\lambda$. What do you observe?\n",
    "1. Use a validation set to find the optimal value of $\\lambda$. Is it really the optimal value? Does this matter?\n",
    "1. What would the update equations look like if instead of $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2$ we used $\\sum_i |w_i|$ as our penalty of choice (this is called $\\ell_1$ regularization).\n",
    "1. We know that $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2 = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{w}$. Can you find a similar equation for matrices (mathematicians call this the [Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm))?\n",
    "1. Review the relationship between training error and generalization error. In addition to weight decay, increased training, and the use of a model of suitable complexity, what other ways can you think of to deal with overfitting?\n",
    "1. In Bayesian statistics we use the product of prior and likelihood to arrive at a posterior via $p(w|x) \\propto p(x|w) p(w)$. How can you identify $p(w)$ with regularization?\n",
