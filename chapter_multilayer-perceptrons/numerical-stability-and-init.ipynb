    "# Numerical Stability and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few sections, each model that we implemented\n",
    "required initializing our parameters according to some specified distribution.\n",
    "However, until now, we glossed over the details,\n",
    "taking the initialization hyperparameters for granted.\n",
    "You might even have gotten the impression that these choices \n",
    "are not especially important.\n",
    "However, the choice of initialization scheme\n",
    "plays a significant role in neural network learning,\n",
    "and can prove essentially to maintaining numerical stability.\n",
    "Moreover, these choices can be tied up in interesting ways \n",
    "with the choice of the activation function.\n",
    "Which nonlinear activation function we choose,\n",
    "and how we decide to initialize our parameters\n",
    "can play a crucial role in making \n",
    "the optimization algorithm converge rapidly. \n",
    "Failure to be mindful of these issues \n",
    "can lead to either exploding or vanishing gradients.\n",
    "In this section, we delve into these topics with greater detail \n",
    "and discuss some useful heuristics that you may use \n",
    "frequently throughout your career in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vanishing and Exploding Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a deep network with $d$ layers, \n",
    "input $\\mathbf{x}$ and output $\\mathbf{o}$. \n",
    "Each layer satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}^{t+1} = f_t (\\mathbf{h}^t) \\text{ and thus } \\mathbf{o} = f_d \\circ \\ldots \\circ f_1(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If all activations and inputs are vectors,\n",
    "we can write the gradient of $\\mathbf{o}$\n",
    "with respect to any set of parameters $\\mathbf{W}_t$ \n",
    "associated with the function $f_t$ at layer $t$ simply as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\partial_{\\mathbf{W}_t} \\mathbf{o} = \\underbrace{\\partial_{\\mathbf{h}^{d-1}} \\mathbf{h}^d}_{:= \\mathbf{M}_d} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\underbrace{\\partial_{\\mathbf{h}^{t}} \\mathbf{h}^{t+1}}_{:= \\mathbf{M}_t} \\underbrace{\\partial_{\\mathbf{W}_t} \\mathbf{h}^t}_{:= \\mathbf{v}_t}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it is the product of $d-t$ matrices \n",
    "$\\mathbf{M}_d \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\mathbf{M}_t$ \n",
    "and the gradient vector $\\mathbf{v}_t$. \n",
    "What happens is similar to the situation \n",
    "when we experienced numerical underflow \n",
    "when multiplying too many probabilities. \n",
    "At the time, we were able to mitigate the problem \n",
    "by switching from into log-space, i.e. by shifting the problem \n",
    "from the mantissa to the exponent of the numerical representation. Unfortunately the problem outlined in the equation above is much more serious: \n",
    "initially the matrices $M_t$ may well have a wide variety of eigenvalues. \n",
    "They might be small, they might be large, and in particular, \n",
    "their product might well be *very large* or *very small*. \n",
    "This is not (only) a problem of numerical representation \n",
    "but it means that the optimization algorithm is bound to fail. \n",
    "It receives gradients that are either \n",
    "excessively large or excessively small.\n",
    "As a result the steps taken are either\n",
    "(i) excessively large (the *exploding* gradient problem),\n",
    "in which case the parameters blow up in magnitude rendering the model useless,\n",
    "or (ii) excessively small, (the *vanishing gradient problem*),\n",
    "in which case the parameters hardly move at all, \n",
    "and thus the learning process makes no progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vanishing Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "One major culprit in the vanishing gradient problem \n",
    "is the choices of the activation functions $\\sigma$ \n",
    "that are interleaved with the linear operations in each layer. \n",
    "Historically, a the sigmoid function $(1 + \\exp(-x))$ \n",
    "(introduced in the [Multilayer Perceptrons section](../chapter_deep-learning-basics/mlp.md))\n",
    "was a popular choice owing to its similarity to a thresholding function.\n",
    "Since early artificial neural networks were inspired \n",
    "by biological neural networks,\n",
    "the idea of neurons that either fire or do not fire \n",
    "(biological neurons do not partially fire) seemed appealing.\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the function \n",
    "to see why picking it might be problematic \n",
    "vis-a-vis vanishing gradients."

    "each element of the weight parameter is randomly sampled \n",
    "with a uniform distribution $U[-0.07, 0.07]$ \n",

    "Moreover, intialization continues to be a hot area of inquiry\n",
    "within research into the fundamental theory of neural network optimization.\n",
    "Some of these heuristics are especially suited \n",
    "for when parameters are tied \n",
    "(i.e., when parameters of in different parts the network are shared), \n",
    "for superresolution, sequence models, and related problems. \n",
    "We recommend that the interested reader take a closer look \n",
    "at what is offered as part of this module,\n",
    "and investigate the recent research on parameter initialization.\n",
    "Perhaps you may come across a recent clever idea \n",
    "and contribute its implementation to MXNet, \n",
    "or you may even invent your own scheme!     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vanishing and exploding gradients are common issues in very deep networks, unless great care is taking to ensure that gradients and parameters remain well controlled.\n",
    "* Initialization heuristics are needed to ensure that at least the initial gradients are neither too large nor too small.\n",
    "* The ReLU addresses one of the vanishing gradient problems, namely that gradients vanish for very large inputs. This can accelerate convergence significantly.\n",
    "* Random initialization is key to ensure that symmetry is broken before optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can you design other cases of symmetry breaking besides the permutation symmetry?\n",
    "1. Can we initialize all weight parameters in linear regression or in softmax regression to the same value?\n",
    "1. Look up analytic bounds on the eigenvalues of the product of two matrices. What does this tell you about ensuring that gradients are well conditioned?\n",
    "1. If we know that some terms diverge, can we fix this after the fact? Look at the paper on LARS by [You, Gitman and Ginsburg, 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03888.pdf) for inspiration.\n",
