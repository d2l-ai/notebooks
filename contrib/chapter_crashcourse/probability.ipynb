    "In some form or another, machine learning is all about making predictions. \n",
    "We might want to predict the *probability* of a patient suffering a heart attack in the next year,\n",

    "In anomaly detection, we might want to assess how *likely* a set of readings from an airplane's jet engine would be,\n",
    "were it operating normally. \n",
    "In reinforcement learning, we want an agent to act intelligently in an environment. \n",
    "This means we need to think about the probability of getting a high reward under each of the available action. \n",
    "And when we build recommender systems we also need to think about probability. \n",
    "For example, if we *hypothetically* worked for a large online bookseller,\n",
    "we might want to estimate the probability that a particular user would buy a particular book, if prompted. \n",
    "For this we need to use the language of probability and statistics. \n",

    "In other words, our ability to tell cats and dogs apart at a large distance (and thus low resolution) \n",
    "might approach uninformed guessing. \n",
    "Probability gives us a formal way of reasoning about our level of certainty.\n",
    "If we are completely sure that the image depicts a cat, \n",
    "we say that the *probability* that the corresponding label $l$ is $\\mathrm{cat}$, \n",
    "denoted $P(l=\\mathrm{cat})$ equals 1.0.\n",
    "If we had no evidence to suggest that $l =\\mathrm{cat}$ or that $l = \\mathrm{dog}$,\n",
    "then we might say that the two possibilities were equally $likely$\n",
    "expressing this as $P(l=\\mathrm{cat}) = 0.5$.\n",
    "If we were reasonably confident, but not sure that the image depicted a cat,\n",
    "we might assign a probability $.5  < P(l=\\mathrm{cat}) < 1.0$.\n",

    "Now consider a second case:\n",
    "given some weather monitoring data,\n",
    "we want to predict the probability that it will rain in Taipei tomorrow.\n",

    "In both cases, we have some value of interest.\n",

    "In this first case, the image is in fact either a dog or a cat, \n",
    "we just don't know which. \n",
    "In the second case, the outcome may actually be a random event,\n",

Fortunately, we don't need it, since we know that $\\sum_y p(y|x) = 1$, hence we can always recover the normalization from $p(y|x) \\propto \\prod_i p(x_i|y) p(y)$. After all that math, it's time for some code to show how to use a Naive Bayes classifier for distinguishing digits on the MNIST classification dataset. \n",

    "The problem is that we don't actually know $p(y)$ and $p(x_i|y)$. So we need to *estimate* it given some training data first. This is what is called *training* the model. In the case of 10 possible classes we simply compute $n_y$, i.e. the number of occurrences of class $y$ and then divide it by the total number of occurrences. E.g. if we have a total of 60,000 pictures of digits and digit 4 occurs 5800 times, we estimate its probability as $\\frac{5800}{60000}$. Likewise, to get an idea of $p(x_i|y)$ we count how many times pixel $i$ is set for digit $y$ and then divide it by the number of occurrences of digit $y$. This is the probability that that very pixel will be switched on."
