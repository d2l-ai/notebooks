    "(i) acquire it! and (ii) process it once it's inside the computer.\n",

    "We'll start by introducing NDArrays, MXNet's primary tool for storing and transforming data. If you've worked with NumPy before, you'll notice that NDArrays are, by design, similar to NumPy's multi-dimensional array. However, they confer a few key advantages. First, NDArrays support asynchronous computation on CPU, GPU, and distributed cloud architectures. Second, they provide support for automatic differentiation. These properties make NDArray an ideal library for machine learning, both for researchers and engineers launching production systems.\n",

In the following example we demonstrate this with Python's `id()` function, which gives us the exact address of the referenced object in memory. After running `y = y + x`, we'll find that `id(y)` points to a different location. That's because Python first evaluates `y + x`, allocating new memory for the result and then subsequently redirects `y` to point at this new location in memory."

Second, we might point at the same parameters from multiple variables. If we don't update in place, this could cause a memory leak, and could cause us to inadvertently reference stale parameters. \n",
