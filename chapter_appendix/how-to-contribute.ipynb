    "# How to Contribute to This Book\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions by readers [1] help us improve this book. If you find a typo, an outdated link, something where you think we missed a citation, where the code doesn't look elegant or where an explanation is unclear, please contribute back and help us help our readers. While in regular books the delay between print runs (and thus between typo corrections) can be measured in years, it typically takes hours to days to incorporate an improvement in this book. This is all possible due to version control and continuous integration testing. To do so you need to install Git and submit a pull request [2] to the GitHub repository. When your pull request is merged into the code repository by the author, you will become a contributor. In a nutshell the process works as described in the diagram below. \n",

    "## From Reader to Contributor in 6 Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk you through the steps in detail. If you are already familiar with Git you can skip this section. For concreteness we assume that the contributor's user name is `smolix`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Git\n",
    "\n",
    "The Git open source book [3] describes how to install Git. This typically works via `apt-get install git` on Ubuntu Linux, by installing the Xcode developer tools on macOS, or by using GitHub's [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com). If you don't have a GitHub account, you need to sign up for one [4].\n",

    "Enter the address of the book's code repository in your browser [2]. Click on the `Fork` button in the red box at the top-right the figure below to make a copy of the repository of this book. This is now *your copy* and you can change it any way you want. \n",

    "To clone the repository (i.e. to make a local copy) we need to get its repository address. The green button on the picture below displays this. Make sure that your local copy is up to date with the main repository if you decide to keep this fork around for longer. For now simply follow the instructions in the [Installation](../chapter_prerequisite/install.md) section to get started. The main difference is that you're now downloading *your own fork* of the repository. \n",
