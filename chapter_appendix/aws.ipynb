    "# Using AWS Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Many deep learning applications require significant amounts of computation. Your local machine might be too slow to solve these problems in a reasonable amount of time. Cloud computing services can give you access to more powerful computers to run the GPU intensive portions of this book. In this section, we will show you how to set up an instance. We will use Jupyter Notebooks to run code on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The walkthrough includes a number of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Request for a GPU instance. \n",
    "1. Optionally: install CUDA or use an AMI with CUDA preinstalled. \n",
    "1. Set up the corresponding MXNet GPU version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process applies to other instances (and other clouds), too, albeit with some minor modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Register Account and Log In\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to register an account at https://aws.amazon.com/. We strongly encourage you to use two-factor authentication for added security. Furthermore, it is a good idea to set up detailed billing and spending alerts to avoid any unexpected surprises if you forget to suspend your computers. Note that you will need a credit card. \n",
    "After logging into your AWS account, click \"EC2\" (marked by the red box in the figure above) to go to the EC2 panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ Open the EC2 console. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/aws.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create and Run an EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 13.9 shows the EC2 panel with sensitive account information greyed out. Select a nearby data center to reduce latency, e.g. Oregon. If you are located in China you can select a nearby Asia Pacific region, such as Seoul or Tokyo. Please note that some data centers may not have GPU instances. Click the \"Launch Instance\" button marked by the red box in Figure 13.8 to launch your instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ EC2 panel. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/ec2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by selecting a suitable AMI (AWS Machine Image). If you want to install everything including the CUDA drivers from scratch, choose Ubuntu. Instead we recommend that you use the Deep Learning AMI that comes with all the drivers preconfigured. \n",
    "\n",
    "The row at the top of Figure 13.10 shows the steps required to configure the instance. Search for *Deep Learning Base* and select the Ubuntu flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ Choose an operating system. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/os.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "EC2 provides many different instance configurations to choose from. This can sometimes feel overwhelming to a beginner. Here's a table of suitable machines:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | GPU         | Notes                         |\n",
    "|------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n",
    "| g2   | Grid K520   | ancient                       |\n",
    "| p2   | Kepler K80  | old but often cheap as spot   |\n",
    "| g3   | Maxwell M60 | good trade-off                |\n",
    "| p3   | Volta V100  | high performance for FP16     |\n",
    "| g4   | Turing T4   | inference optimized FP16/INT8 |\n",
    "\n",
    "All the above servers come in multiple flavors indicating the number of GPUs used. E.g. a p2.xlarge has 1 GPU and a p2.16xlarge has 16 GPUs and more memory. For more details see e.g. the [AWS EC2 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) or a [summary page](https://www.ec2instances.info). For the purpose of illustration a p2.xlarge will suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** you must use a GPU enabled instance with suitable drivers and a version of MXNet that is GPU enabled. Otherwise you will not see any benefit from using GPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "![ Choose an instance. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/p2x.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before choosing an instance, we suggest you check if there are quantity restrictions by clicking the \"Limits\" label in the bar on the, as left shown in Figure 13.9. As shown in Figure 13.12, this account can only open one \"p2.xlarge\" instance per region. If you need to open more instances, click on the \"Request limit increase\" link to apply for a higher instance quota. Generally, it takes one business day to process an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ Instance quantity restrictions. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/limits.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we keep the default configurations for the steps \"3. Configure Instance\", \"5. Add Tags\", and \"6. Configure Security Group\". Tap on \"4. Add Storage\" and increase the default hard disk size to 64 GB. Note that CUDA by itself already takes up 4GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ Modify instance hard disk size. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/disk.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, go to \"7. Review\" and click \"Launch\" to launch the configured instance. The system will now prompt you to select the key pair used to access the instance. If you do not have a key pair, select \"Create a new key pair\" in the first drop-down menu in Figure 13.14 to generate a key pair. Subsequently, you can select \"Choose an existing key pair\" for this menu and then select the previously generated key pair. Click \"Launch Instances\" to launch the created instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ Select a key pair. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/keypair.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you download the keypair and store it in a safe location if you generated a new one. This is your only way to SSH into the server. Click the instance ID shown in Figure 13.15 to view the status of this instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ Click the instance ID. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/launching.png)\n",

The next time you want to use this instance, you can follow the steps for creating and running an EC2 instance described in this section to create an instance based on the saved image. The only difference is that, in \"1. Choose AMI\" shown in Figure 13.10, you must use the \"My AMIs\" option on the left to select your saved image. The created instance will retain the information stored on the image hard disk. For example, you will not have to reinstall CUDA and other runtime environments.\n",
