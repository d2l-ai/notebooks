    "# Single Shot Multibox Detection (SSD)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous few sections, we have introduced bounding boxes, anchor boxes, multiscale object detection, and data sets. Now, we will use this background knowledge to construct an object detection model: single shot multibox detection (SSD)[1]. This quick and easy model is already widely used. Some of the design concepts and implementation details of this model are also applicable to other object detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## model\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 9.4 shows the design of an SSD model. The model's main components are a base network block and several multiscale feature blocks connected in a series. Here, the base network block is used to extract features of original images, and it generally takes the form of a deep convolutional neural network. The paper on SSDs chooses to place a truncated VGG before the classification layer[1], but this is now commonly replaced by ResNet. We can design the base network so that it outputs larger heights and widths. In this way, more anchor boxes are generated based on this feature map, allowing us to detect smaller objects. Next, each multiscale feature block reduces the height and width of the feature map provided by the previous layer (for example, it may reduce the sizes by half). The blocks then use each element in the feature map to expand the receptive field on the input image. In this way, the closer a multiscale feature block is to the top of Figure 9.4 the smaller its output feature map, and the fewer the anchor boxes that are generated based on the feature map. In addition, the closer a feature block is to the top, the larger the receptive field of each element in the feature map and the better suited it is to detect larger objects. As the SSD generates different numbers of anchor boxes of different sizes based on the base network block and each multiscale feature block and then predicts the categories and offsets (i.e., predicted bounding boxes) of the anchor boxes in order to detect objects of different sizes, SSD is a multiscale object detection model.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/notebooks/master/img/ssd.png\" alt=\"The SSD is composed of a base network block and several multiscale feature blocks connected in a series. \" width=379 height=232/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will describe the implementation of the modules in the figure. First, we need to discuss the implementation of category prediction and bounding box prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Category Prediction Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the number of object categories to $q$. In this case, the number of anchor box categories is $q+1$, with 0 indicating an anchor box that only contains background. For a certain scale, set the height and width of the feature map to $h$ and $w$, respectively. If we use each element as the center to generate $a$ anchor boxes, we need to classify a total of $hwa$ anchor boxes. If we use a fully connected layer (FCN) for the output, this will likely result in an excessive number of model parameters. Recall how we used convolutional layer channels to output category predictions in the [\"Network in Network (NiN)\"](../chapter_convolutional-neural-networks/nin.md) section. SSD uses the same method to reduce the model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the category prediction layer uses a convolutional layer that maintains the input height and width. Thus, the output and input have a one-to-one correspondence to the spatial coordinates along the width and height of the feature map. Assuming that the output and input have the same spatial coordinates $(x,y)$, the channel for the coordinates $(x,y)$ on the output feature map contains the category predictions for all anchor boxes generated using the input feature map coordinates $(x,y)$ as the center. Therefore, there are $a(q+1)$ output channels, with the output channels indexed as $i(q+1) + j$ ($0 \\leq j \\leq q$) representing the predictions of the category index $j$ for the anchor box index $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will define a category prediction layer of this type. After we specify the parameters $a$ and $q$, it uses a $3\\times3$ convolutional layer with a padding of 1. The heights and widths of the input and output of this convolutional layer remain unchanged."

Because the shapes and number of anchor boxes centered on the same element differ for the feature maps of different scales, the prediction outputs at different scales may have different shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we use the same batch of data to construct feature maps of two different scales, `Y1` and `Y2`. Here, `Y2` has half the height and half the width of `Y1`. Using category prediction as an example, we assume that each element in the `Y1` and `Y2` feature maps generates five (Y1) or three (Y2) anchor boxes. When there are 10 object categories, the number of category prediction output channels is either $5\\times(10+1)=55$ or $3\\times(10+1)=33$. The format of the prediction output is (batch size, number of channels, height, width). As you can see, except for the batch size, the sizes of the other dimensions are different. Therefore, we must transform them into a consistent format and concatenate the predictions of the multiple scales to facilitate subsequent computation."
