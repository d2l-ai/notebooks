    "# Anchor Boxes\n",

    "Object detection algorithms usually sample a large number of regions in the input image, determine whether these regions contain objects of interest, and adjust the edges of the regions so as to predict the ground-truth bounding box of the target more accurately. Different models may use different region sampling methods. Here, we introduce one such method: it generates multiple bounding boxes with different sizes and aspect ratios while centering on each pixel. These bounding boxes are called anchor boxes. We will practice object detection based on anchor boxes in the following sections.\n",

Because printing NDArray actually calls the print function of NumPy, the floating-point numbers in NDArray printed in this section are more concise."

    "\n",
    "We just mentioned that the anchor box covers the dog in the image well. If the ground-truth bounding box of the target is known, how can \"well\" here be quantified? An intuitive method is to measure the similarity between anchor boxes and the ground-truth bounding box. We know that the Jaccard index can measure the similarity between two sets. Given sets $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$, their Jaccard index is the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union:\n",

In this way, we can measure the similarity of the two bounding boxes by the Jaccard index of their pixel sets. When we measure the similarity of two bounding boxes, we usually refer the Jaccard index as Intersection over Union (IoU), which is the ratio of the intersecting area to the union area of the two bounding boxes, as shown in Figure 9.2. The value range of IoU is between 0 and 1: 0 means that there are no overlapping pixels between the two bounding boxes, while 1 indicates that the two bounding boxes are equal.\n",

    "## Labeling Training Set Anchor Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the training set, we consider each anchor box as a training example. In order to train the object detection model, we need to mark two types of labels for each anchor box: first, the category of the target contained in the anchor box (category) and, second, the offset of the ground-truth bounding box relative to the anchor box (offset). In object detection, we first generate multiple anchor boxes, predict the categories and offsets for each anchor box, adjust the anchor box position according to the predicted offset to obtain the bounding boxes to be used for prediction, and finally filter out the prediction bounding boxes that need to be output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that, in the object detection training set, each image is labelled with the location of the ground-truth bounding box and the category of the target contained. After the anchor boxes are generated, we primarily label anchor boxes based on the location and category information of the ground-truth bounding boxes similar to the anchor boxes. So how do we assign ground-truth bounding boxes to anchor boxes similar to them?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the anchor boxes in the image are $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{n_a}$ and the ground-truth bounding boxes are $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{n_b}$ and $n_a \\geq n_b$. Define matrix $\\boldsymbol{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_a \\times n_b}$, where element $x_{ij}$ in the $i$th row and $j$th column is the IoU of the anchor box $A_i$ to the ground-truth bounding box $B_j$.\n",
    "First, we find the largest element in the matrix $boldsymbol{x}$ and record the row index and column index of the element as $i_1,j_1$. We assign the ground-truth bounding box $B_{j_1}$ to the anchor box $A_{i_1}$. Obviously, anchor box $A_{i_1}$ and ground-truth bounding box $B_{j_1}$ have the highest similarity among all the \"anchor box - ground-truth bounding box\" pairings. Next, discard all elements in the $i_1$th row and the $j_1$th column in the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$. Find the largest remaining element in the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and record the row index and column index of the element as $i_2,j_2$. We assign ground-truth bounding box $B_{j_2}$ to anchor box $A_{i_2}$ and then discard all elements in the $i_2$th row and the $j_2$th column in the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$. At this point, elements in two rows and two columns in the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ have been discarded.\n",
    "We proceed until all elements in the $n_b$ column in the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ are discarded. At this time, we have assigned a ground-truth bounding box to each of the $n_b$ anchor boxes.\n",

Given anchor box $A_i$, find the bounding box $B_j$ with the largest IoU with $A_i$ according to the $i$th row of the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$, and only assign ground-truth bounding box $B_j$ to anchor box $A_i$ when the IoU is greater than the predetermined threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure 9.3 (left), assuming that the maximum value in the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is $x_{23}$, we will assign ground-truth bounding box $B_3$ to anchor box $A_2$. Then, we discard all the elements in row 2 and column 3 of the matrix, find the largest element $x_{71}$ of the remaining shaded area, and assign ground-truth bounding box $B_1$ to anchor box $A_7$. Then, as shown in Figure 9.3 (middle), discard all the elements in row 7 and column 1 of the matrix, find the largest element $x_{54}$ of the remaining shaded area, and assign ground-truth bounding box $B_4$ to anchor box $A_5$.  Finally, as shown in Figure 9.3 (right), discard all the elements in row 5 and column 4 of the matrix, find the largest element $x_{92}$ of the remaining shaded area, and assign ground-truth bounding box $B_2$ to anchor box $A_9$.  After that, we only need to traverse the remaining anchor boxes of $A_2, A_5, A_7, A_9$ and determine whether to assign ground-truth bounding boxes to the remaining anchor boxes according to the threshold.\n",

Because the positions and sizes of various boxes in the data set may vary, these relative positions and relative sizes usually require some special transformations to make the offset distribution more uniform and easier to fit. Assume the center coordinates of anchor box $A$ and its assigned ground-truth bounding box $B$ are $(x_a, y_a), (x_b, y_b)$, the widths of $A$ and $B$ are $w_a, W_b$, and their heights are $h_a, h_b$, respectively.

Here, we construct five anchor boxes to be labeled by the coordinates of the upper-left corner and the lower-right corner, which are recorded as $A_0, \\ldots, A_4$, respectively (the index in the program starts from 0). First, draw the positions of these anchor boxes and the ground-truth bounding boxes in the image."

    "During model prediction phase, we first generate multiple anchor boxes for the image and then predict categories and offsets for these anchor boxes one by one. Then, we obtain prediction bounding boxes based on anchor boxes and their predicted offsets. When there are many anchor boxes, many similar prediction bounding boxes may be output for the same target. To simplify the results, we can remove similar prediction bounding boxes. A commonly used method is called non-maximum suppression (NMS).\n",

Assume the largest predicted probability is $p$, the category corresponding to this probability is the predicted category of $B$. We also refer to $p$ as the confidence level of prediction bounding box $B$. On the same image, we sort the prediction bounding boxes with predicted categories other than background by confidence level from high to low, and obtain the list $L$. Select the prediction bounding box $B_1$ with highest confidence level from $L$ as a baseline and remove all non-benchmark prediction bounding boxes with an IoU with $B_1$ greater than a certain threshold from $L$. The threshold here is a preset hyper-parameter. At this point, $L$ retains the prediction bounding box with the highest confidence level and removes other prediction bounding boxes similar to it.\n",

Finally, output all prediction bounding boxes in the list $L$.\n",

We can see that the shape of the returned result is (batch size, number of anchor boxes, 6). The 6 elements of each row represent the output information for the same prediction bounding box. The first element is the predicted category index, which starts from 0 (0 is dog, 1 is cat). The value -1 indicates background or removal in NMS. The second element is the confidence level of prediction bounding box. The remaining four elements are the $x, y$ axis coordinates of the upper-left corner and the $x, y$ axis coordinates of the lower-right corner of the prediction bounding box (the value range is between 0 and 1)."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* We generate multiple anchor boxes with different sizes and aspect ratios, centered on each pixel.\n",
    "* IoU is the ratio of the intersecting area to the union area of two bounding boxes.\n",
    "* In the training set, we mark two types of labels for each anchor box: one is the category of the target contained in the anchor box and the other is the offset of the ground-truth bounding box relative to the anchor box.\n",
    "* When predicting, we can use non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove similar prediction bounding boxes, thereby simplifying the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change the `sizes` and `ratios` values in `contrib.nd.MultiBoxPrior` and observe the changes to the generated anchor boxes.\n",
    "* Construct two bounding boxes with and IoU of 0.5, and observe their coincidence.\n",
    "* Verify the output of offset `labels[0]` by marking the anchor box offsets as defined in this section (the constant is the default value).\n",
    "* Modify the variable `anchors` in the \"Labeling Training Set Anchor Boxes\" and \"Output Bounding Boxes for Prediction\" sections. How do the results change?\n",
