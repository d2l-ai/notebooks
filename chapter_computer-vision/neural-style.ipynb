    "# Neural Style Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use social sharing apps or happen to be an amateur photographer, you are familiar with filters. Filters can alter the color styles of photos to make the background sharper or people's faces whiter. However, a filter generally can only change one aspect of a photo. To create the ideal photo, you often need to try many different filter combinations. This process is as complex as tuning the hyper-parameters of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss how we can use convolution neural networks (CNNs) to automatically apply the style of one image to another image, an operation known as style transfer[1]. Here, we need two input images, one content image and one style image. We use a neural network to alter the content image so that its style mirrors that of the style image. In Figure 9.12, the content image is a landscape photo the author took in Mount Rainier National Part near Seattle. The style image is an oil painting of oak trees in autumn. The output composite image retains the overall shapes of the objects in the content image, but applies the oil painting brushwork of the style image and makes the overall color more vivid.\n",

    "## Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 9.13 shows an output of the CNN-based style transfer method. First, we initialize the composite image. For example, we can initialize it as the content image. This composite image is the only variable that needs to be updated in the style transfer process, i.e. the model parameter to be updated in style transfer. Then, we select a pre-trained CNN to extract image features. These model parameters do not need to be updated during training. The deep CNN uses multiple neural layers that successively extract image features. We can select the output of certain layers to use as content features or style features. If we use the structure in Figure 9.13, the pretrained neural network contains three convolutional layers. The second layer outputs the image content features, while the outputs of the first and third layers are used as style features. Next, we use forward propagation (in the direction of the solid lines) to compute the style transfer loss function and backward propagation (in the direction of the dotted lines) to update the model parameter, constantly updating the composite image. The loss functions used in style transfer generally have three parts: 1. Content loss is used to make the composite image approximate the content image as regards content features. 2. Style loss is used to make the composite image approximate the style image in terms of style features. 3. Total variation loss helps reduce the noise in the composite image. Finally, after we finish training the model, we output the style transfer model parameters to obtain the final composite image.\n",

    "Next, we will perform an experiment to help us better understand the technical details of style transfer.\n",

In general, the closer an output is to the input layer, the easier it is to extract image detail information. The farther away an output is, the easier it is to extract global information. To prevent the composite image from retaining too many details from the content image, we select a VGG network layer near the output layer to output the image content features. This layer is called the content layer. We also select the outputs of different layers from the VGG network for matching local and global styles. These are called the style layers. As we mentioned in the [\"Networks Using Duplicates (VGG)\"](../chapter_convolutional-neural-networks/vgg.md) section, VGG networks have five convolutional blocks. In this experiment, we select the last convolutional layer of the fourth convolutional block as the content layer and the first layer of each block as style layers.

    "Style loss, similar to content loss, uses a square error function to measure the difference in style between the composite image and style image. To express the styles output by the style layers, we first use the `extract_features` function to compute the style layer output. Assuming that the output has 1 example, $c$ channels, and a height and width of $h$ and $w$, we can transform the output into the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$, which has $c$ rows and $h \\cdot w$ columns. You can think of matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ as the combination of the $c$ vectors $\\boldsymbol{x}_1, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{x}_c$, which have a length of $hw$. Here, the vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ represents the style feature of channel $i$. In the Gram matrix of these vectors $\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{X}^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c \\times c}$, element $x_{ij}$ in row $i$ column $j$ is the inner product of vectors $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}_j$. It represents the correlation of the style features of channels $i$ and $j$. We use this type of Gram matrix to represent the style output by the style layers. You must note that, when the $h \\cdot w$ value is large, this often leads to large values in the Gram matrix. In addition, the height and width of the Gram matrix are both the number of channels $c$. To ensure that the style loss is not affected by the size of these values, we define the `gram` function below to divide the Gram matrix by the number of its elements, i.e. $c \\cdot h \\cdot w$."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The loss functions used in style transfer generally have three parts: 1. Content loss is used to make the composite image approximate the content image as regards content features. 2. Style loss is used to make the composite image approximate the style image in terms of style features. 3. Total variation loss helps reduce the noise in the composite image.\n",
    "* We can use a pre-trained CNN to extract image features and minimize the loss function to continuously update the composite image.\n",
    "* We use a Gram matrix to represent the style output by the style layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does the output change when you select different content and style layers?\n",
    "* Adjust the weight hyper-parameters in the loss function. Does the output retain more content or have less noise?\n",
    "* Use different content and style images. Can you create more interesting composite images?\n",
