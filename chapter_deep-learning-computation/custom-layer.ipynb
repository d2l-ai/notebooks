    "# Custom Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons for the success of deep learning can be found in the wide range of layers that can be used in a deep network. This allows for a tremendous degree of customization and adaptation. For instance, scientists have invented layers for images, text, pooling, loops, dynamic programming, even for computer programs. Sooner or later you will encounter a layer that doesn't exist yet in Gluon, or even better, you will eventually invent a new layer that works well for your problem at hand. This is when it's time to build a custom layer. This section shows you how.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layers without Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is slightly intricate, we start with a custom layer (aka Block) that doesn't have any inherent parameters. Our first step is very similar to when we [introduced blocks](model-construction.md) previously. The following `CenteredLayer` class constructs a layer that subtracts the mean from the input. We build it by inheriting from the Block class and implementing the `forward` method."

    "Now that we know how to define layers in principle, let's define layers with parameters. These can be adjusted through training. In order to simplify things for an avid deep learning researcher the `Parameter` class and the `ParameterDict` dictionary provide some basic housekeeping functionality. In particular, they govern access, initialization, sharing, saving and loading model parameters. For instance, this way we don't need to write custom serialization routines for each new custom layer.\n",
