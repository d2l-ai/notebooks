    "So far we discussed how to process data, how to build, train and test deep learning models. However, at some point we are likely happy with what we obtained and we want to save the results for later use and distribution. Likewise, when running a long training process it is best practice to save intermediate results (checkpointing) to ensure that we don't lose several days worth of computation when tripping over the power cord of our server. At the same time, we might want to load a pretrained model (e.g. we might have word embeddings for English and use it for our fancy spam classifier). For all of these cases we need to load and store both individual weight vectors and entire models. This section addresses both issues.\n",

    "## Gluon Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving individual weight vectors (or other NDArray tensors) is useful but it gets very tedious if we want to save (and later load) an entire model. After all, we might have hundreds of parameter groups sprinkled throughout. Writing a script that collects all the terms and matches them to an architecture is quite some work. For this reason Gluon provides built-in functionality to load and save entire networks rather than just single weight vectors. An important detail to note is that this saves model *parameters* and not the entire model. I.e. if we have a 3 layer MLP we need to specify the *architecture* separately. The reason for this is that the models themselves can contain arbitrary code, hence they cannot be serialized quite so easily (there is a way to do this for compiled models - please refer to the [MXNet documentation](http://www.mxnet.io) for the technical details on it). The result is that in order to reinstate a model we need to generate the architecture in code and then load the parameters from disk. The [deferred initialization](deferred-init.md) is quite advantageous here since we can simply define a model without the need to put actual values in place. Let's start with our favorite MLP."
