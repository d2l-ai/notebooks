    "\n",
    "When we implemented linear regression from scratch in the previous section, we had to define the model parameters and explicitly write out the calculation to produce output using basic linear algebra opertions. You should know how to do this. But once your models get more complex, even qualitatively simple changes to the model might result in many low-level changes.\n",

    "which defines a large number of neural network layers\n",
    "(note that \"nn\" is an abbreviation for neural networks). \n",
    "We will first define a model variable `net`, which is a `Sequential` instance. In Gluon, a `Sequential` instance can be regarded as a container \n",
    "that concatenates the various layers in sequence. \n",
    "When input data is given, each layer in the container will be calculated in order, and the output of one layer will be the input of the next layer.\n",
    "In this example, since our model consists of only one layer,\n",
    "we do not really need `Sequential`.\n",
    "But since nearly all of our future models will involve multiple layers, \n",

    "1. If we replace `l = loss(output, y)` with `l = loss(output, y).mean()`, we need to change `trainer.step(batch_size)` to `trainer.step(1)` accordingly. Why?\n",
    "1. Review the MXNet documentation to see what loss functions and initialization methods are provided in the modules `gluon.loss` and `init`. Replace the loss by Huber's loss.\n",
