    "The Transformer model is also based on the encoder-decoder architecture. It, however, differs to the seq2seq model that the transformer replaces the recurrent layers in seq2seq with attention layers. To deal with sequential inputs, each item in the sequential is copied as the query, the key and the value as illustrated in the following figure. It therefore outputs a same length sequential output. We call such an attention layer as a self-attention layer. \n",

    "The transformer architecture, with a comparison to the seq2seq model with attention, is shown in the following figure. These two models are similar to each other in overall: the source sequence embeddings are fed into $n$ repeated blocks. The outputs of the last block are then used as attention memory for the decoder. \n",
    "The target sequence embeddings is similarly fed into $n$ repeated blocks in the decoder, and the final outputs are obtained by applying a dense layer with vocabulary size to the last block's outputs. \n",

    "It can also be seen that the transformer differs to the seq2seq with attention model in three major places:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A recurrent layer in seq2seq is replaced with a transformer block. This block contains a self-attention layer (muti-head attention) and a network with two dense layers (position-wise FFN) for the encoder. For the decoder, another mut-head attention layer is used to take the encoder state.\n",
    "1. The encoder state is passed to every transformer block in the decoder, instead of using as an additional input of the first recurrent layer in seq2seq. \n",
    "1. Since the self-attention layer does not distinguish the item order in a sequence, a positional encoding layer is used to add sequential information into each sequence item. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this section, we will explain every new layer introduced by the transformer, and construct a model to train on the machine translation dataset."

At time step $t$, assume $\\mathbf x_t$ is the current input, i.e. the query. Then keys and values of the self-attention layer consist of the current query with all past queries $\\mathbf x_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf x_{t-1}$. \n",
