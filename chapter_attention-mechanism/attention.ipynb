    "# Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [\"Sequence to Sequence\"]() section we encode the source sequence input information in the recurrent unit state, and then pass it to the decoder to generate the target sequence. A token in the target sequence may closely relate to some tokens in the source sequence instead of the whole source sequence. For example, when translating \"Hello world.\" to \"Bonjour le monde.\", \"Bonjour\" maps to \"Hello\" and \"monde\" maps to \"world\". In the seq2seq model, the decoder may implicitly select the corresponding information from the state passed by the decoder. The attention mechanism, however, makes this selection explicit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core component in the attention mechanism is the attention layer, or called attention for simplicity. An input of the attention layer is called a query. For a query, the attention layer returns the output based on its memory, which is a set of key-value pairs. To be more specific, assume a query $\\mathbf{q}\\in\\mathbb R^{d_q}$, and the memory contains $n$ key-value pairs, $(\\mathbf{k}_1, \\mathbf{v}_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{k}_n, \\mathbf{v}_n)$, with $\\mathbf{k}_i\\in\\mathbb R^{d_k}$, $\\mathbf{v}_i\\in\\mathbb R^{d_v}$. The attention layer then returns an output $\\mathbf o\\in\\mathbb R^{d_v}$ with the same shape has a value. \n",

    "\n",
    "To compute the output, we first assume there is a score function $\\alpha$ which measure the similarity between the query and a key. Then we compute all $n$ scores $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_i = \\alpha(\\mathbf q, \\mathbf k_i).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we use softmax to obtain the attention weights\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b_1, \\ldots, b_n = \\textrm{softmax}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is then a weight sum of the values  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf o = \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i \\mathbf v_i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Different choices of the score function lead to different attention layers. We will discuss two commonly used attention layers in the rest of this section. Before diving into the implementation, we first introduce a masked version of the softmax operator and explain a specialized dot operator `nd.batched_dot`."
