    "LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG all share a common design pattern: \n",
    "extract features exploiting *spatial* structure\n",
    "via a sequence of convolutions and pooling layers \n",
    "and then post-process the representations via fully-connected layers. \n",
    "The improvements upon LeNet by AlexNet and VGG mainly lie \n",
    "in how these later networks widen and deepen these two modules. \n",
    "Alternatively, one could imagine using fully-connected layers \n",
    "earlier in the process. \n",
    "However, a careless use of dense layers might give up the \n",
    "the spatial structure of the representation entirely, \n",

    "at each pixel location (for each height and  width).\n",
    "If we tie the weights across each spatial location,\n",
    "we could think of this as a $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer\n",
    "(as described in our section on [channels](channels.md))\n",
    "or as a fully-connected layer acting indepdendently on each pixel location.  \n",

    "* NiN uses blocks consisting of a convolutional layer and multiple $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer. This can be used within the convolutional stack to allow for more per-pixel nonlinearity.\n",
