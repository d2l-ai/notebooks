    "# Networks Using Blocks (VGG)\n",
    "\n",
    "While AlexNet proved that deep convolutional neural networks \n",
    "can achieve good results, it didn't offer a general template\n",
    "to guide subsequent researchers in designing new networks. \n",
    "In the following sections, we will introduce several heuristic concepts\n",
    "commonly used to design deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Progress in this field mirrors that in chip design \n",
    "where engineers went from placing transistors\n",
    "to logical elements to logic blocks. \n",
    "Similarly, the design of neural nework architectures \n",
    "had grown progressively more abstract,\n",
    "with researchers moving from thinking in terms of \n",
    "individual neurons to whole layers, \n",
    "and now to blocks, repeating patterns of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of using blocks first emerged from the \n",
    "[Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) (VGG) \n",
    "at Oxford University. \n",
    "In their eponymously-named VGG network,\n",

    "## VGG Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic building block of classic convolutional networks \n",
    "is a sequence of the following layers:\n",
    "(i) a convolutional layer \n",
    "(with padding to maintain the resolution), \n",
    "(ii) a nonlinearity such as a ReLu,\n",
    "One VGG block consistis of a sequence of convolutional layers, \n",
    "followed by a max pooling layer for spatial downsampling. \n",
    "In the original VSS paper,\n",
    "[Simonyan and Ziserman, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) \n",
    "employed convolutions with $3\\times3$ kernels \n",
    "and $2 \\times 2$ max pooling with stride of $2$\n",
    "(halving the resolution after each block). \n",
    "In the code below, we define a function called `vgg_block` \n",
    "to implement one VGG block. \n",
    "The function takes two arguments\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* VGG-11 constructs a network using reusable convolutional blocks. Different VGG models can be defined by the differences in the number of convolutional layers and output channels in each block.\n",
    "* The use of blocks leads to very compact representations of the network definition. It allows for efficient design of complex networks.\n",
    "* In their work Simonyan and Ziserman experimented with various architectures. In particular, they found that several layers of deep and narrow convolutions (i.e. $3 \\times 3$) were more effective than fewer layers of wider convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When printing out the dimensions of the layers we only saw 8 results rather than 11. Where did the remaining 3 layer informations go?\n",
    "1. Compared with AlexNet, VGG is much slower in terms of computation, and it also needs more GPU memory. Try to analyze the reasons for this.\n",
    "1. Try to change the height and width of the images in Fashion-MNIST from 224 to 96. What influence does this have on the experiments?\n",
    "1. Refer to Table 1 in the original [VGG Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) to construct other common models, such as VGG-16 or VGG-19.\n",
